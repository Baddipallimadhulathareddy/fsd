Experiment 5(a): Design and Normalize a Database Schema up to 3NF
Aim
To design a relational database schema and normalize it up to the Third Normal Form (3NF).
Theory
Database normalization is a process used to minimize data redundancy and improve data integrity. It involves dividing large tables into smaller related tables and defining relationships among them.
Procedure / Steps
1.	Install MySQL Server and MySQL Workbench.
2.	Open MySQL Workbench and connect to your local MySQL server.
3.	Create a new database using: CREATE DATABASE college;
4.	Identify entities: STUDENT, COURSE, DEPARTMENT, ENROLLMENT.
5.	Define relationships between entities using ER diagram tools.
6.	Normalize tables from 1NF → 2NF → 3NF.
7.	Create the final schema with foreign keys and constraints.
Source Code / SQL Commands
CREATE TABLE department (
  department_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  department_name VARCHAR(100),
  department_head VARCHAR(100)
);
CREATE TABLE student (
  student_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100),
  dob DATE,
  department_id INT,
  email VARCHAR(100),
  FOREIGN KEY (department_id) REFERENCES department(department_id)
);
CREATE TABLE course (
  course_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  course_name VARCHAR(100),
  credits INT,
  department_id INT,
  FOREIGN KEY (department_id) REFERENCES department(department_id)
);
CREATE TABLE enrollment (
  enroll_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  student_id INT,
  course_id INT,
  enrollment_date DATE,
  grade VARCHAR(5),
  FOREIGN KEY (student_id) REFERENCES student(student_id),
  FOREIGN KEY (course_id) REFERENCES course(course_id)
);
Expected Output
The schema should show separate tables for Student, Department, Course, and Enrollment with all keys properly defined.
Result
Database schema was successfully designed and normalized up to 3NF.
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS college; USE college;

  department_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  department_name VARCHAR(100),
  department_head VARCHAR(100)

CREATE TABLE course(
  course_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
