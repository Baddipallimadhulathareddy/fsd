Experiment 5(b): Perform SQL-based CRUD Operations using MySQL
Aim
To perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on the MySQL database created earlier.
Theory
CRUD operations are the fundamental actions used in persistent storage systems to manipulate data.
Procedure / Steps
1.	Install and launch MySQL Workbench.
2.	Connect to your MySQL server and open the 'college' database.
3.	Use CREATE TABLE commands to define the schema if not already present.
4.	Insert sample records using INSERT INTO.
5.	Retrieve records using SELECT.
6.	Modify data using UPDATE.
7.	Delete specific records using DELETE.
Source Code / SQL Commands
INSERT INTO department (department_name, department_head) VALUES ('CSE', 'Dr. Rao');
INSERT INTO student (name, dob, department_id, email) VALUES ('Praneel', '1982-01-14', 1, 'praneel@example.com');
SELECT * FROM student;
UPDATE student SET email='updated@example.com' WHERE student_id=1;
DELETE FROM student WHERE student_id=1;
Expected Output
Records should be inserted, displayed, updated, and deleted successfully from each table.
Result
CRUD operations on MySQL database were successfully executed and verified.
